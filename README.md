### Organisation of the repository ###

The repository is organised as follows:
* Dataset: This folder contains the datasets in yaml format that we used for our project.
* Notebooks: This folder contains the ipynb files for data cleaning and serialisation for rdf triples.
* Ontology: This folder contains the .ttl file for our ontology and the visual schema of the same.
* RDFTriples: This folder contains the rdf triples (.ttl files) generated using the ontology and notebooks.

### Description of our Ontology ###
For our project, we have chosen to use the Women's T20 International Cricket Dataset from link mentioned above.
The dataset includes detailed match information such as players, teams, runs, balls, deliveries, etc. for each match over a time span from 2009 to 2019. We intend to model an ontology that answers the over all match details - toss result, venue of the match, players of each team, winning runs and so on - for each match provided in the dataset.
