### Description of our Ontology ###
For our project, we have chosen to use the Women's T20 International Cricket Dataset from link mentioned above.
The dataset includes detailed match information such as players, teams, runs, balls, deliveries, etc. for each match over a time span from 2009 to 2019. We intend to model an ontology that answers the over all match details - toss result, venue of the match, players of each team, winning runs and so on - for each match provided in the dataset.
